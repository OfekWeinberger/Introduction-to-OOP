=============================
SpaceShip.java - An abstract SpaceShip that implements everything that is the same in all ships, leaving only
the behavior and appearance of the ship to be implemented
SpaceShipComputerControlled.java - An abstract class that implements the appearance of all computer controlled
 ships. leaving the implementation of the behavior only.
SpaceShipHumanControlled.java - Implements the human controlled ship, including user input.
SpaceShipAggressive.java - Implements the aggressive algorithm.
SpaceShipBasher.java - Implements the basher algorithm.
SpaceShipDrunkard.java - Implements my own drunkard algorithm.
SpaceShipRunner.java - Implements the runner algorithm.
SpaceShipSpecial.java - Implements my own special ship algorithm.
SpaceShipFactory.java - The class responsible of creating the ship objects for the game.

=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I designed the classes with abstract mechanism: The SpaceShip object is an abstract object that implements all
 the attributes common in all ship-types - everything all of the ships have in common. most of it is game
 rules and general behavior (like shooting and cooldown functions). Then the SpaceShipComputerControlled,
 also abstract is inheriting the SpaceShip attributes and implements the getImage() function - that is the
 same for all the AI ship. This resulting in every AI ship only needing to implements its' specific behavior,
 thus creating easy-to-read code, and saving on double-code.
The human controlled ship directly inherits the SpaceShip attributes and implements all the required methods.

=============================
Drunkard - It is based on random. It randomly shoots and shields. It is also driving like crazy drunkard
because it is always accelerating and even the turning have some random base in it.
Special - This is sort of aggressive 2.0, it acts similar to the aggressive but when it's health bars is low
enough, it will always try to turn shield. This improved algorithm resulted in a drastic improvement in game -
I tested the game for over an hour with all AI against another and the special ship was much better.
