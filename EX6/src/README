Parser.java - This class parses and scans the lines of the code one by one, creating the correct scopes, and
    calling to the correct syntax objects (CodeLine, MethodDeclaration, Condition...) and giving them the
    right parameters.
Sjavac.java - This is the main class of the program, requires path of sjava file as argument.
IfWhile.java - This class is the implementation of the if\while scope.
Method.java - This class is the implementation of the method scope, holds the methods and the variables of the
    root scope, but also defines it's own variable name space.
Root.java - This class is the implementation of the root scope (global scope) that holds all it's methods and
    also the global variables.
Scope.java - This is the abstract father class of all scopes, implements everything any scope must have.
CodeLine.java - This class responsible for scanning a single line of code, throwing exception if illegal.
Condition.java - This class responsible for scanning a condition phrase, throwing exception of illegal.
IllegalSyntaxException.java - The exception thrown whenever a part of the code finds an illegal syntax.
MethodDeclaration.java - This class responsible for scanning a method declaration, throwing exception if
    illegal. The class keeps the parameter and the name of the method.
Type.java - This is an enum that defines the types available in sJava, it also implements few useful methods
    related to the types.
Variable.java - This class implement a variable in sJava, it doesn't save it's value but saves everything
    related to the syntax checking: assignment status, if it is final, the type of the variable and it's name.
RegularExpressions.java - This is a class that holds the patterns and regexes we use in the program.
SJavaFileHandler.java - This class responsible for all the file and initial text handling in the program.

Our main design principle was like building a syntax tree: constructing the parameters and the methods of the
global scope then going method by method and starting to check the syntax. In case of if or while we
immediately start to check it (opening a new scope) and do it recursively. Anywhere checking the syntax, an
IllegalSyntaxException can be thrown, otherwise the file is legal.

Our programs reads the file, and creates a list
(ArrayList) of all the lines of the file. It is done while deleting all the unnecessary white spaces to make
the strings easier to work with. After that we pass the lines to the root scope. Scopes are objects that
generally define the name space of variables; Each scope has a collection of all the variables that are declared
specifically in that scope. Each scope is connected to his parent scope and throw that connection can check and access
parent methods (in case of root) or variables in case of all other scopes. After passing the lines to root scope,
it scans the lines, creating methods and variables (without scanning the lines of the methods). Then there is
a second scan, for each of the methods. in each method the parser scans the line and if there is another scope
block (if/while) it opens a new scope and scans it's lines, so if another scope (if/while) is declared inside,
it the program will create new scope for it, and scan it's lines before going back to the outer one.

It is important to notice the scanning is made inside a parser class that scans the code lines one by one.
When finished scanning, it goes  back to the outer scope. When the scanning of the root lines, the program
returns a result of a valid file: Anywhere in the code the IllegalSyntaxException can be thrown, with
informative message. The exception is caught then the program knows the code is illegal according the sJava
language specifications.

On validating the correctness of a line there are classes all implementing the checker interface. Those classes have
each a type of line they know to validate its correctness. The parser goal is to send each one the
correct type of lines.

====================
=   Question 6.1   =
====================

The main exception we threw in our code is the IllegalSyntaxException, that was thrown every time the syntax
was not compatible with the s-Java code specifications. This exception requires an informative message that is
defined in part of the code that threw the exception. There were other exceptions that could be thrown in the
code, not directly because of wrong syntax, but rather because of trying to match the code lines to a
certain pattern we expect from the s-Java. We handled these potential, many exceptions with using many
conditions that check if an exception could be thrown, and if so - an IllegalSyntaxException is thrown because
the conditions manage the flow of the program so if there is any chance the code written in the file is
correct - it will find it legal.

====================
=   Question 6.2   =
====================

Our object oriented design was fairly simple: There are few general syntax objects: CodeLine, Condition,
MethodDeclaration. In addition there are scopes, Scope is an abstract class that implement everything
that any scope must have, scopes are objects that define the name space of variables; Each scope has a
collection of all the variables method that his father scope has (except for root that has only it's own
variables). The scope types are: Root, Method and IfWhile (if and while are combined because there is no real
difference between them).

We thought of few partially \ totally different designs:
1) using a dictionary (hashmap) of strings and variables to hold the variables in the program. The strings are starting
with the depth where the variable was decleared and after that the name of the variable. we chose to not implement this
idea because it is not modular and all the program will need to access it. It breakes continuity of the code and breaks
single responsibility principle because it handles all the variables of all scopes and not only the relevant ones.
2) making an object of each line. we chose not to use this idea because it uses a lot of memory and waste runtime for
long codes. instead we create classes that know to check different type of lines and so we can modulate the checks with
those dynamical checkers.

If we wanted to add more variables, we need to:
1. Add them to the type enum.
2. Add the relevant regexes and patterns that can check if a certain input is valid.
3. Add them to the switch case in the CodeLine class.

If we wanted to add different method types:
We would, in the MethodDeclaration, add a return type member, and according to it, make sure there is a
return statement in the method while scanning it's lines.

If we wanted the add the methods of standard java:
We would need to add an array of methods with the names and the parameter that belong to the methods we want
to add (for example: name=System.out.println and param=String). Then in case the method that is called is not
recognized as one of the methods declared in the global scope, then check if the method call fits the name and
 parameter of one of the methods in the "java methods" list.

====================
=   Question 6.3   =
====================

In our program we used many regular expressions to make our life easier, here are some of them that we find
particularly interesting:

1. BOOLEAN_REGEX = "(true)|(false)|(([1-9]+[0-9]*)|(0))|([0-9]+.[0-9]+)": This regex is the one we used in
order to define if certain String can represent a boolean, and in addition if we can assign this value to a
boolean. As in the s-Java specifications, this regex only matches one of the following: A boolean word
("true" or "false"), double value or int value. "(true)|(false)" matches to a boolean word,
"(([1-9]+[0-9]*)|(0))" matches to an int and "([0-9]+.[0-9]+)" matches to a double. The "|" between them
represent a logical "OR" relation.

2. AFTER_TRIMMER_REGEX = "(?<=[\\{;\\(,=\\)\\}])[\\s]+": This regex is helping us in a process where we want
to remove unnecessary white-spaces from the code, helping us to scan the code more efficiently (It is easier
to check syntax when we know better how the code should look like). This specific regex will match (for
deletion) any white-space that has "{", "}", ";", "(", ")", "=", "," before them. We also implemented a
similar one for any white spaces that are before any of these characters.

3. METHOD_CALL_REGEX = "([a-zA-Z]\\w*)[\\(][\\w,_\\s]*[\\)];": This regex is helping use to find if a method
call is legal or not. A method call consists of a method name, then "(", the parameters given to the method
and then ");"
